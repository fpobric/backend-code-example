- Project with CQRS pattern

## Getting Started and step to follow in order to run the project

Execute commands in you terminal as follows:
- git clone https://github.com/fpobric/softhouse-task-backend.git
- navigate to your project
Open it in Microsoft Visual studio
- start project and make sure it's running on port 7078 as frontend project will try to reach localhost:7078/api

You can use swagger to execute methods in controllers.
For better experience, start frontend project and test it.

I did not implemented Authorization in the controllers, just checking if user has been authenticated and has valid token.
